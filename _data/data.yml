The result of the simulation is visualized in horizontal, vertical and 3 dimensional diagrams (OpenGL). Many software experts have been added to meet the very specific needs of TDF engineers. For example, this software is the only one capable of calculating antenna propagation for DTT. About 200 copies of this application are deployed for TDF engineers as well as in foreign subsidiaries.
          * Specification and design of the application.
          * Project manager of the project team (4 people) and Technical Manager.
